    /*
    The TypeScript code you provided defines a variable transactions that is an array of elements with a specific type .

Here's a breakdown of the code:

const transactions: This declares a constant variable named transactions. 
This variable will hold an array of elements with a specific  (type of Tx in fact) .


(Omit<{ receipt: TransactionReceipt; data: () => Promise<unknown>; }, "data"> | 
Transaction<Omit<{ receipt: TransactionReceipt; data: () => Promise<unknown>; }, "data">>)[]: 
This is the type definition for the transactions array (Tx[]). 

Let's break it down further:

Omit<{ receipt: TransactionReceipt; data: () => Promise<unknown>; }, "data">: 
This is a type created using TypeScript's Omit utility type. 
It takes an object type as its first parameter and a string literal type as its second parameter. 
In this case, it removes the "data" property from the object type. 
So, it represents an object type that has 
a "receipt" property of type TransactionReceipt and a "data" property that is a function returning a promise of unknown type.

Transaction<Omit<{ receipt: TransactionReceipt; data: () => Promise<unknown>; }, "data">>: 
This is another type. It represents an object of type Transaction that has properties similar to the object type defined above 
(with "data" removed).

|: This is the union type operator.
 It means that each element of the transactions array can have one of two types: 
 either the type defined by the first part (Omit<...>) or the type defined by the second part (Transaction<...>).

[]: Finally, the entire type definition is wrapped in square brackets, 
indicating that transactions is an array containing elements of the defined type.

In summary, the transactions array can hold elements that are either objects with 
a "receipt" property of type TransactionReceipt and a "data" property of type () => Promise<unknown> (with "data" removed), or
objects of type Transaction with similar properties. 
This is a way to define an array that can hold two different types of objects or a combination of both.
